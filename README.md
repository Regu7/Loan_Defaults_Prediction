# End to End Machine Learning Project - Loan Default Prediction for LendingClub

## Problem Statement

**Loan Default Prediction for LendingClub**

LendingClub is a leading peer-to-peer lending company that connects borrowers with investors. The company needs to make informed decisions about loan approvals based on the applicantâ€™s profile to minimize financial risks. The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a loan applicant will fully repay the loan or default (charged-off).

### Business Context

When a loan application is received, LendingClub faces two types of risks:

- **Loss of Business**: If an applicant who is likely to repay the loan is not approved, the company loses potential business.
- **Financial Loss**: If an applicant who is likely to default is approved, the company incurs a financial loss.

### Objective

The goal is to develop a predictive model using historical data of past loan applicants to identify patterns that indicate whether a person is likely to default. This model will help LendingClub make data-driven decisions to:

- Approve or deny loans
- Adjust loan amounts
- Set appropriate interest rates for risky applicants
